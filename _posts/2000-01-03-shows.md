###*I have lots of experience with:*

##MAGIC, COMEDY, JUGGLING, ESCAPES, PICK-POCKETING, MIND READING, AND MORE!

The best way to choose from all the great San Francisco magicians is to read
their reviews on Yelp, watch their videos on Youtube, and call them on the
phone to get a feel for their personality. Ask a lot of questions and if you
feel there is a good connection, that they explained exactly what they do
clearly , and they understand your needs, then you have found your
entertainer.

I offer (I like how http://www.billherz.com/ has a section on magical
services with descriptions when you scroll down a bit on the landing page):
A stand up show that lasts from 5 to 60 minutes (to fill the time that is
best for your needs)
Master of Ceremonies, Host, MC, Moderator, Auctioneer, etc.
A series of shows for your event
Close-up/Strolling/Mingling/Walk Around/Atmosphere entertainment
A large illusion show
A variety show with many entertainers
Team building workshops
Combination of the above
